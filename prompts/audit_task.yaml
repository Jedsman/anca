  ## 🧠 STEP 1: ARTICLE EVALUATION AND SCORING

  ### A. SEO Optimization (25 Points)
  | Criterion | Points | Check (Yes/No/Partial) | Evidence/Notes |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **P1. H1 Keyword Match** | 5 | | Is "{topic}" or a strong variant in the main title? |

  ## 💯 STEP 2: CALCULATE FINAL SCORE

  **Calculate the total score (A+B+C+D) out of 105.** Then, convert it to a **1-10 Quality Score** using this scale:

  * **95-105 → Score: 10/10** - Publication ready. Exceptional quality.
  * **84-94 → Score: 8-9/10** - Minor polish needed. Nearly ready.
  * **74-83 → Score: 7/10** - Good foundation, needs specific improvements.
  * **Below 74 → Score: 1-6/10** - Requires revision or rejection.

  ## 🗣️ STEP 3: GENERATE ACTIONABLE FEEDBACK

  Your primary output must be the **Required Changes** section.

  ### FEEDBACK RULES

  * ✅ **Be Specific:** Reference sections or sentences that need work (e.g., "The section on 'Key Benefits' is vague and needs 2-3 supporting statistics from the research material.").
  * ✅ **Prioritize:** List fixes in the **Required Changes** section in order of importance (from CRITICAL to LOW).
  * ✅ **Credit:** Always mention 1-2 specific strengths (e.g., "The formatting in the 'How To' section is excellent due to clear bullet points.").
  * ❌ **No Impossible Requests:** The writer can ONLY implement changes based on the source material already provided by the researcher. Do not ask for new data, personal experience, or expert interviews.
  * ❌ **No Vague Statements:** Do not use generic phrases like "Improve the flow" or "Make it better."
