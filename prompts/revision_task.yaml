  # REVISION TASK

  You are revising a blog post about: **{topic}**

  The SEO Auditor has provided feedback. Your job is to implement ALL required changes to achieve a 10/10 score.

  ---
  ## STEP 1: FIND THE ARTICLE FILE

  Look at the previous output for the filename. It should say:
  `Article written to: [filename].md`

  **Common filename patterns:**
  - The topic with spaces replaced by hyphens: e.g., `homebrew-coffee.md`
  - All lowercase
  - Ends with `.md`

  If you can't find the filename, construct it from the topic:
  - "{topic}" → lowercase → replace spaces with hyphens → add `.md`

  ---
  ## STEP 2: READ THE CURRENT ARTICLE

  ```
  FileReaderTool(filename="[filename].md")
  ```

  Read the entire article into memory. You need to understand:
  - Current structure (what H2 sections exist)
  - Current length (approximately how many words)
  - Current quality (what's working, what's not)

  ---
  ## STEP 3: REVIEW THE AUDIT FEEDBACK

  From the Auditor's report, identify:

  1. **CRITICAL issues** - Must fix or article fails
  2. **HIGH priority** - Significantly improves quality
  3. **MEDIUM priority** - Noticeable improvement
  4. **LOW priority** - Polish if time permits

  ---
  ## STEP 4: IMPLEMENT CHANGES

  Address each issue systematically. **TARGET LENGTH: 2,000+ WORDS.**
  If the article is short, you MUST expand it by adding details, examples, and data.

  ### EXPANSION STRATEGY (Use these targets):
  - **Introduction:** 150+ words
  - **What is it?:** 300+ words
  - **Benefits:** 300+ words
  - **How-To Guide:** 800+ words (Deep dive!)
  - **Common Mistakes:** 250+ words
  - **FAQ:** 200+ words

  ### For "Add more content" feedback:
  ```
  RAGTool(action="retrieve", query="[specific topic needing expansion]")
  ```
  Then incorporate the retrieved information with specific details and examples.

  ### For "Improve structure" feedback:
  - Reorganize headers logically
  - Break up long paragraphs
  - Add bullet points where appropriate

  ### For "Add statistics/data" feedback:
  ```
  RAGTool(action="retrieve", query="statistics data numbers about [the topic]")
  ```
  Add specific numbers to support claims.

  ### For "Strengthen intro/conclusion" feedback:
  - Intro: Add a hook (question, surprising fact, or bold statement) and ensure it is 150+ words.
  - Conclusion: Summarize 3 key takeaways + clear call to action.

  ### For "Add FAQ section" feedback:
  Create 5+ Q&A pairs (200+ words total) based on:
  ```
  RAGTool(action="retrieve", query="frequently asked questions about [the topic]")
  ```
  DO NOT use the same quer mroe than once. Duplicates are not allowed.
  ---
  ## STEP 5: SAVE THE REVISED ARTICLE

  Save to the SAME filename (overwrite the original):

  ```
  FileWriterTool(
    filename="[same-filename].md",
    content="[YOUR COMPLETE REVISED ARTICLE]"
  )
  ```

  **IMPORTANT:** Include the ENTIRE article, not just changed sections.

  ---
  ## QUALITY CHECKLIST (Verify Before Saving)

  Before saving, confirm:

  - [ ] Word count is 1,800-2,200 words (optimal SEO range)
  - [ ] All CRITICAL issues from audit are addressed
  - [ ] Headers follow H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy
  - [ ] Primary keyword appears in H1 and first paragraph
  - [ ] Article has introduction, body sections, and conclusion
  - [ ] Paragraphs are short (≤ 4 sentences)
  - [ ] Uses bullet points and bold for key terms
  - [ ] Content density is high: NO filler, NO padding, every paragraph adds specific value
